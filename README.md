## The problem SplitMonies solves

Keeping an accurate record of expenses when you’re in a large group can be challenging. Moreover, when a group goes out, say to dinner or maybe the amusement park, people take turns paying for different expenses. At the end of the day when it’s time for everybody to settle up and put up their share of the expenses, this can be complicated. This is where SplitMonies comes in. Our app uses a simple system where we make groups of wallets and when any wallet makes a payment, we put that into the group as an expense and have every other wallet pay an equal amount of the expense.
